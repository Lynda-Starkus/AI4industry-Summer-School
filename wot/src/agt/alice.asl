/*
Alice is an agent. Its "cognitive" state is composed of
- beliefs (atomic statements, as in Prolog) and
- goals (atomic statements prefixed with '!' or '?').

The following line initializes the agent's state with a belief that gives what 
credentials it should use to interact with the simulated manufacturing line.

TODO: replace N with your group number to obtain, e.g. "simu1", or "simu2", or etc.

   EXERCISES

1. Edit the '!start' plan below to read the TD of the VL10 workshop and print its
properties to the console.

Look at https://gitlab.emse.fr/ai4industry/hackathon/-/wikis/conveying-workshop
for more details about the VL10 workshop.

2. Re-write the plan so that Alice sets the conveyor speed of the VL10 workshop
to 0.5 (m/s) and then picks an item at position (0,0).

That will be all for now. More details about the Jason language will be given
in the MAS lecture.
